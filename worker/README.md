# TabRecap Gateway Worker

Cloudflare Worker wrapper for the default free TabRecap AI gateway.

The extension sends chat-completions-compatible planner requests to this Worker.
The Worker validates the request, applies coarse anti-abuse limits, injects the
real upstream API key on the server side, and forwards only to the configured
upstream base URL.

For the current production hostnames, local Mac origin, Cloudflare Tunnel,
monitoring email, logs, and migration checklist, see
[`docs/12-default-ai-gateway-runbook.md`](../docs/12-default-ai-gateway-runbook.md).

## What It Protects

- No upstream API key is shipped in the extension.
- Clients cannot override the upstream target.
- Only the TabRecap text-model allowlist is accepted by default. It mirrors the
  current CLIProxyAPI origin chat models, including `gpt-5.5`, `gpt-5.4`,
  `gpt-5.4-mini`, `codex-auto-review`, Claude Opus/Sonnet/Haiku variants, and
  `gpt-5.3-codex-spark`. The spark model is allowed for bounded progress UI
  copy and compact auxiliary TabRecap planning shapes; generic chat remains
  rejected. Image models are intentionally excluded because this Worker only
  exposes `/v1/chat/completions`.
- Request body size and `max_tokens` are capped before upstream forwarding.
- KV counters limit global, IP, install-id, and page-summary usage.

This is not account-grade billing control. It is a practical free-tier abuse
brake for an open-source browser extension before login exists.

## Required Cloudflare Resources

Create a Workers KV namespace and bind it as `RATE_LIMIT_KV`. This repository
includes `worker/wrangler.toml` for the current public route. For another
deployment, copy `worker/wrangler.toml.example` to your own config and fill in
the KV namespace ID.

Use a Worker route for the public extension domain:

```toml
routes = [
  { pattern = "cliproxy.sylvanyu.io/*", zone_name = "sylvanyu.io" }
]
```

Keep the raw LLM gateway on a separate origin host such as
`https://cliproxy-origin.sylvanyu.io/v1`. Do not set `UPSTREAM_BASE_URL` to
`https://cliproxy.sylvanyu.io/v1`, because that would make the Worker call
itself recursively.

Set upstream values as Worker secrets:

```bash
npx wrangler secret put UPSTREAM_BASE_URL
npx wrangler secret put UPSTREAM_API_KEY
```

For a local-machine origin, keep the retry budget small. These are normal
Worker vars, already present in `worker/wrangler.toml`:

```toml
UPSTREAM_RETRY_ATTEMPTS = "2"
UPSTREAM_RETRY_DELAY_MS = "1200"
UPSTREAM_READY_TIMEOUT_MS = "8000"
LLM_READY_MODEL = "gpt-5.4-mini"
LLM_READY_REASONING_EFFORT = "low"
LLM_READY_MAX_TOKENS = "2"
LLM_READY_TIMEOUT_MS = "45000"
ALERT_TO = "me@sylvanyu.io"
ALERT_FROM = "TabRecap Monitor <alerts@sylvanyu.io>"
MONITOR_REMINDER_HOURS = "6"
```

The Worker retries only Cloudflare/Tunnel infrastructure failures such as
`530` with `error code: 1033`, `502`, `503`, `504`, and Cloudflare `52x`
origin errors. It does not retry model validation failures, `401`, `403`, or
`429`, so it should not silently double-spend normal model requests.

If the origin LLM gateway is behind Cloudflare Access, also set:

```bash
npx wrangler secret put CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_ID
npx wrangler secret put CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_SECRET
```

Then deploy:

```bash
npx wrangler deploy --config worker/wrangler.toml
```

Health check:

```bash
curl https://cliproxy.sylvanyu.io/healthz
```

The Worker health response is `{"ok":true}`. This only proves the Worker is
deployed. It does not prove the local origin machine, API-only proxy, or
Cloudflare Tunnel is reachable.

Readiness check:

```bash
curl https://cliproxy.sylvanyu.io/readyz
```

`/readyz` calls the configured upstream health endpoint. By default it checks
`/healthz` at the `UPSTREAM_BASE_URL` origin, so
`UPSTREAM_BASE_URL=https://cliproxy-origin.sylvanyu.io/v1` checks
`https://cliproxy-origin.sylvanyu.io/healthz`. Override with
`UPSTREAM_HEALTH_URL` only if the origin uses a different health path.

LLM readiness check:

```bash
npx wrangler secret put MONITOR_TOKEN --config worker/wrangler.toml
curl -H "x-monitor-token: $MONITOR_TOKEN" https://cliproxy.sylvanyu.io/llm-readyz
```

`/llm-readyz` is intentionally separate from `/readyz`:

- `/readyz` is free and only verifies Worker -> Tunnel -> local origin health.
- `/llm-readyz` spends a tiny amount of model usage by sending one protected
  `gpt-5.4-mini`, `reasoning_effort=low`, `max_tokens=2` chat request through
  the real upstream path.
- The endpoint returns `401` unless the request includes `x-monitor-token` or
  `Authorization: Bearer ...` matching the `MONITOR_TOKEN` Worker secret.

Use `/llm-readyz` as a low-frequency external monitor. The current production
policy is every 30 minutes with email alerts, while `/readyz` can run every
1-3 minutes.

Scheduled email monitoring:

```bash
npx wrangler secret put RESEND_API_KEY --config worker/wrangler.toml
npx wrangler deploy --config worker/wrangler.toml
```

The Worker has a Cron Trigger:

```toml
[triggers]
crons = ["*/30 * * * *"]
```

Every 30 minutes it checks both the local-origin readiness path and the tiny
real LLM probe. It sends email through the Resend HTTP API only when state
changes:

- first detected outage;
- recovery after an outage;
- reminder after `MONITOR_REMINDER_HOURS` while still down.

If `RESEND_API_KEY`, `ALERT_TO`, or `ALERT_FROM` is missing, the scheduled job
returns early and does not run the real LLM probe, so it will not spend model
usage before email delivery is configured.

Each chat request now carries an `x-tab-recap-request-id` response header. The
extension sends the side-panel operation id as this header for default gateway
traffic, so a user-visible error can be matched with Worker logs and local
origin logs.

When the local Tunnel is down, the Worker converts raw Cloudflare failures into
JSON such as:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "origin_tunnel_unavailable",
    "message": "The local TabRecap AI origin is offline or its Cloudflare Tunnel has no healthy connection.",
    "requestId": "recap_..."
  }
}
```

That is intentionally different from relaying an HTML/`error code: 1033` body
to the extension.

## Local-Machine Origin Checklist

The production-facing hostname can still use a local Mac as the origin, but the
chain must stay up:

```text
extension -> cliproxy.sylvanyu.io Worker -> cliproxy-origin.sylvanyu.io tunnel -> 127.0.0.1:18317 -> 127.0.0.1:8317
```

Operational checks, in order:

```bash
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:8317/healthz
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:18317/healthz
curl -sS https://cliproxy-origin.sylvanyu.io/healthz
curl -sS https://cliproxy.sylvanyu.io/readyz
```

If `/healthz` on `cliproxy.sylvanyu.io` is 200 but `/readyz` is 503, the Worker
is alive and the local origin path is not. Restart the local CLIProxyAPI stack
and Cloudflare Tunnel before changing extension code or model settings.

## Local Tests

```bash
npm run test:worker
```

The tests use an in-memory KV and mocked upstream fetch. They never call the
real LLM gateway.
