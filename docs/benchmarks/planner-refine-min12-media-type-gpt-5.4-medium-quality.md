# Planner Benchmark Quality Analysis

Generated: 2026-06-26T12:00:56.387Z

This report evaluates synthetic benchmark outputs against explicit fixture truth when available, with URL-path inference kept only for older benchmark files. Review tabs are treated as singleton clusters, so coverage and recall drop when the planner leaves tabs for manual confirmation.

## Inputs

- `docs/benchmarks/data/planner-scale-2026-06-26T09-30-04-592Z-pid10702.json` (planner-scale-2026-06-26T09-30-04-592Z-pid10702, partial: false)

## Reading The Numbers

- Topic precision answers: when Tab Tidy puts two tabs in the same group, how often do they share the fine-grained synthetic topic?
- Topic recall answers: among tabs that share a fine-grained synthetic topic, how often did Tab Tidy keep them together?
- Family F1 is a coarser workflow-level score. It helps distinguish useful broad grouping from genuinely wrong mixed groups.
- Coverage is not accuracy. Higher review counts can improve safety but reduce automatic organization completeness.
- New benchmark files can carry explicit `benchmarkTruth.topicByTabId`; older files fall back to URL path inference.
- These are synthetic fixtures. They are useful for regression testing planner behavior, not a substitute for real browsing-session review.
