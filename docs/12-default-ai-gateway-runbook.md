# Default AI Gateway Runbook

Status: current production path as of 2026-07-02 01:44 CST.

This document records the public TabRecap AI gateway setup so it can be
debugged, migrated, or rebuilt later without relying on memory. It intentionally
records names, hostnames, file paths, commands, and expected health signals. It
does not record API keys, tokens, or passwords.

## What This Gateway Is

TabRecap ships without a user-visible API key. The default free AI service is a
Cloudflare Worker in front of a local Mac-hosted OpenAI-compatible gateway.

The current request chain is:

```text
TabRecap extension
  -> https://cliproxy.sylvanyu.io/v1/chat/completions
  -> Cloudflare Worker: tab-tidy-gateway
  -> https://cliproxy-origin.sylvanyu.io/v1
  -> Cloudflare Tunnel: cliroxyapi
  -> 127.0.0.1:18317 API-only proxy on the Mac
  -> 127.0.0.1:8317 CLIProxyAPI on the Mac
  -> upstream model account
```

Important distinction:

- `cliproxy.sylvanyu.io` is the product-facing hostname used by the extension.
  HTTP requests are handled by the Worker route.
- `cliproxy-origin.sylvanyu.io` is the raw origin Tunnel hostname used by the
  Worker.
- `UPSTREAM_BASE_URL` must point to `https://cliproxy-origin.sylvanyu.io/v1`,
  not `https://cliproxy.sylvanyu.io/v1`, otherwise the Worker can call itself
  recursively.

## Public Hostnames

| Hostname | Role | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cliproxy.sylvanyu.io` | Product-facing AI gateway | Cloudflare Worker route |
| `cliproxy-origin.sylvanyu.io` | Raw local origin tunnel | Cloudflare Tunnel `cliroxyapi` |
| `sylvanyu.io` | Website and email domain | separate from AI gateway |
| `hermes.sylvanyu.io` | Separate tunnel/service | not part of TabRecap AI gateway |

The DNS page can show `cliproxy.sylvanyu.io` as a Tunnel record. That is not
the whole story: the Worker route for `cliproxy.sylvanyu.io/*` is what makes the
extension traffic go through validation, quotas, secret injection, retries, and
monitoring.

## Local Machine

Local project:

```text
/Users/yuyufeng/Projects/CLIProxyAPI
```

Main local service:

```text
127.0.0.1:8317
```

API-only local proxy:

```text
127.0.0.1:18317
```

The API-only proxy forwards only:

```text
/healthz
/v1
/v1/*
```

It should return `404` for management pages such as `/management.html`. Do not
expose `127.0.0.1:8317` directly to the public internet.

Important files:

```text
/Users/yuyufeng/Projects/CLIProxyAPI/config.yaml
/Users/yuyufeng/Projects/CLIProxyAPI/.codex/v1-only-proxy.mjs
/Users/yuyufeng/Projects/CLIProxyAPI/.codex/cliproxyapi-watchdog.sh
/Users/yuyufeng/.cloudflared/config.yml
/Users/yuyufeng/Library/LaunchAgents/com.router-for-me.cliproxyapi.plist
/Users/yuyufeng/Library/LaunchAgents/com.router-for-me.cliproxyapi-v1-proxy.plist
/Users/yuyufeng/Library/LaunchAgents/com.cloudflare.cloudflared.cliproxyapi.plist
/Users/yuyufeng/Library/LaunchAgents/com.router-for-me.cliproxyapi-watchdog.plist
```

Current Cloudflare Tunnel config:

```yaml
tunnel: 35aaf3af-06b2-4d7e-b391-b607fc9bf2fd
credentials-file: /Users/yuyufeng/.cloudflared/35aaf3af-06b2-4d7e-b391-b607fc9bf2fd.json
protocol: http2

ingress:
  - hostname: cliproxy-origin.sylvanyu.io
    service: http://127.0.0.1:18317
  - hostname: cliproxy.sylvanyu.io
    service: http://127.0.0.1:18317
  - service: http_status:404
```

`protocol: http2` is intentional. It was added after QUIC tunnel failures caused
Cloudflare `530 / 1033` responses while `cloudflared` was still running.

## Local Service Commands

Use the helper script instead of ad hoc commands:

```bash
/Users/yuyufeng/.codex/skills/cliroxyapi-service/scripts/manage-cliroxyapi-service.sh status
/Users/yuyufeng/.codex/skills/cliroxyapi-service/scripts/manage-cliroxyapi-service.sh smoke
/Users/yuyufeng/.codex/skills/cliroxyapi-service/scripts/manage-cliroxyapi-service.sh restart
/Users/yuyufeng/.codex/skills/cliroxyapi-service/scripts/manage-cliroxyapi-service.sh stop
/Users/yuyufeng/.codex/skills/cliroxyapi-service/scripts/manage-cliroxyapi-service.sh start
```

`status` checks processes, local health, public origin health, public Worker
health, and launchd state. `smoke` sends one real public chat request through
the Worker and local origin.

Current healthy status snapshot, 2026-07-02 01:44 CST:

```text
main local 8317: 200
proxy local 18317: 200
public origin health: 200
public origin models: 200
public main health: 200
public main ready: 200

launchd:
com.router-for-me.cliproxyapi: loaded
com.router-for-me.cliproxyapi-v1-proxy: loaded
com.cloudflare.cloudflared.cliproxyapi: loaded
```

Current public smoke snapshot, 2026-07-02 01:44 CST:

```text
HTTP_STATUS: 200
TOTAL_TIME: 21.37s
model: gpt-5.5
```

The service is usable, but it is still a Mac-hosted free service, not a managed
cloud SLA.

## Worker

Worker config lives in the TabRecap repo:

```text
/Users/yuyufeng/Projects/tab-recap/worker/wrangler.toml
```

Worker name:

```text
tab-tidy-gateway
```

Public route:

```toml
routes = [
  { pattern = "cliproxy.sylvanyu.io/*", zone_name = "sylvanyu.io" }
]
```

Cron trigger:

```toml
[triggers]
crons = ["*/30 * * * *"]
```

Current deployed Worker code version:

```text
a87a141e-6018-481c-a412-2233a4bd3f0c
```

Current effective Worker version after the Resend secret change:

```text
989a82f5-31e2-4581-b88b-9f2f9d48512f
```

Worker secrets currently configured:

```text
UPSTREAM_BASE_URL
UPSTREAM_API_KEY
MONITOR_TOKEN
RESEND_API_KEY
```

Worker vars currently configured:

```toml
ALERT_TO = "me@sylvanyu.io"
ALERT_FROM = "TabRecap Monitor <alerts@sylvanyu.io>"
MONITOR_REMINDER_HOURS = "6"
LLM_READY_MODEL = "gpt-5.4-mini"
LLM_READY_REASONING_EFFORT = "low"
LLM_READY_MAX_TOKENS = "2"
LLM_READY_TIMEOUT_MS = "45000"
UPSTREAM_RETRY_ATTEMPTS = "2"
UPSTREAM_RETRY_DELAY_MS = "1200"
UPSTREAM_READY_TIMEOUT_MS = "8000"
```

Useful Worker commands:

```bash
cd /Users/yuyufeng/Projects/tab-recap
npx wrangler deploy --config worker/wrangler.toml
npx wrangler secret list --config worker/wrangler.toml
npx wrangler secret put RESEND_API_KEY --config worker/wrangler.toml
npx wrangler secret put UPSTREAM_BASE_URL --config worker/wrangler.toml
npx wrangler secret put UPSTREAM_API_KEY --config worker/wrangler.toml
npx wrangler secret put MONITOR_TOKEN --config worker/wrangler.toml
npx wrangler tail --config worker/wrangler.toml
```

Do not put secret values in shell history or source files.

## Health Checks

Fast checks:

```bash
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:8317/healthz
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:18317/healthz
curl -sS https://cliproxy-origin.sylvanyu.io/healthz
curl -sS https://cliproxy.sylvanyu.io/healthz
curl -sS https://cliproxy.sylvanyu.io/readyz
```

Expected meanings:

| Check | Healthy result | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `127.0.0.1:8317/healthz` | 200 | CLIProxyAPI main service is up |
| `127.0.0.1:18317/healthz` | 200 | API-only proxy is up |
| `cliproxy-origin.sylvanyu.io/healthz` | 200 | Tunnel reaches the Mac proxy |
| `cliproxy.sylvanyu.io/healthz` | 200 | Worker route is alive |
| `cliproxy.sylvanyu.io/readyz` | 200 | Worker reaches origin health |

Real model-path check:

```bash
TOKEN="$(cat /Users/yuyufeng/Projects/CLIProxyAPI/.runtime-secrets/cliproxy-monitor-token)"
curl -sS -H "x-monitor-token: $TOKEN" https://cliproxy.sylvanyu.io/llm-readyz
```

`/llm-readyz` spends a tiny model request. It should not be polled frequently.
The Worker Cron already runs it every 30 minutes after email alerts are
configured.

## Monitoring And Email

The Worker runs a Cron monitor every 30 minutes.

Checks:

1. Worker to origin readiness via `/readyz`.
2. Real LLM path via `/llm-readyz`, using:

   ```text
   model: gpt-5.4-mini
   reasoning_effort: low
   max_tokens: 2
   ```

Email delivery:

```text
Provider: Resend
From: TabRecap Monitor <alerts@sylvanyu.io>
To: me@sylvanyu.io
```

Alert rules:

- first outage sends an email;
- repeated failures are quiet;
- persistent failure sends another email after 6 hours;
- recovery sends a recovery email.

If `RESEND_API_KEY`, `ALERT_TO`, or `ALERT_FROM` is missing, the scheduled job
returns before running the real LLM probe, so it does not spend model usage
without a working alert channel.

Resend test email was sent and received on 2026-07-02. Resend returned:

```text
7c5180ba-4542-43e5-8d73-3333ee5bd1cd
```

DNS/email coexistence notes:

- Migadu receiving mail remains on `sylvanyu.io` MX records:
  `aspmx1.migadu.com` and `aspmx2.migadu.com`.
- Migadu DKIM remains on `key1._domainkey`, `key2._domainkey`, and
  `key3._domainkey`.
- Resend uses `resend._domainkey.sylvanyu.io`, so it does not overwrite Migadu
  selectors.
- `send.sylvanyu.io` has separate Amazon SES records and does not affect
  `me@sylvanyu.io`.

```

Worker logs:

```bash
cd /Users/yuyufeng/Projects/tab-recap
npx wrangler tail --config worker/wrangler.toml
```

Useful local log commands:

```bash
tail -n 80 /Users/yuyufeng/Projects/CLIProxyAPI/.runtime-logs/cloudflared.screen.log
tail -n 80 /Users/yuyufeng/Projects/CLIProxyAPI/.runtime-logs/watchdog.out.log
launchctl print gui/$(id -u)/com.router-for-me.cliproxyapi-watchdog
```

## When The Service Is Down

Start with:

```bash
/Users/yuyufeng/.codex/skills/cliroxyapi-service/scripts/manage-cliroxyapi-service.sh status
```

Then:

```bash
/Users/yuyufeng/.codex/skills/cliroxyapi-service/scripts/manage-cliroxyapi-service.sh smoke
```

Interpretation:

| Symptom | Likely cause | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| local `8317` fails | CLIProxyAPI main service down | run helper `restart` |
| local `18317` fails | API-only proxy down | run helper `restart` |
| local healthy, origin public 530 | Cloudflare Tunnel unhealthy | restart tunnel/full stack |
| Worker `/healthz` 200, `/readyz` fails | Worker up, origin path down | inspect tunnel/local services |
| `/readyz` 200, chat fails | model route/upstream issue | inspect Worker tail and CLIProxyAPI logs |
| `401` from origin direct `/v1` | normal for raw origin without key | test via Worker instead |
| `530` / `error code: 1033` | Cloudflare has no healthy origin connection | restart tunnel; verify `protocol: http2` |

Default recovery:

```bash
/Users/yuyufeng/.codex/skills/cliroxyapi-service/scripts/manage-cliroxyapi-service.sh restart
/Users/yuyufeng/.codex/skills/cliroxyapi-service/scripts/manage-cliroxyapi-service.sh status
/Users/yuyufeng/.codex/skills/cliroxyapi-service/scripts/manage-cliroxyapi-service.sh smoke
```

If `cloudflared` is running but public checks still return 530, inspect
Cloudflare tunnel logs. If logs show QUIC timeouts or no free edge addresses,
keep `protocol: http2` and restart the tunnel.

## Migration Checklist

Use this when moving the origin from this Mac to another machine or a server.

1. Provision the new origin.

   - Install CLIProxyAPI.
   - Install Node for `.codex/v1-only-proxy.mjs`.
   - Install `cloudflared`.
   - Copy or recreate `config.yaml` with model-provider credentials.
   - Do not expose `8317` publicly.

2. Recreate the API-only proxy.

   - Listen on `127.0.0.1:18317`.
   - Forward only `/healthz`, `/v1`, and `/v1/*`.
   - Verify `/management.html` returns 404.

3. Recreate or move the Cloudflare Tunnel.

   - Keep `cliproxy-origin.sylvanyu.io` as the raw origin hostname, or update
     the Worker `UPSTREAM_BASE_URL` secret if the hostname changes.
   - Keep `protocol: http2` unless there is a reason to revisit transport.

4. Recreate service supervision.

   - Prefer launchd/systemd/managed service over manual shell sessions.
   - Add a watchdog equivalent to check local main, local proxy, and Worker
     readiness.

5. Update Worker secrets if needed.

   ```bash
   cd /Users/yuyufeng/Projects/tab-recap
   npx wrangler secret put UPSTREAM_BASE_URL --config worker/wrangler.toml
   npx wrangler secret put UPSTREAM_API_KEY --config worker/wrangler.toml
   npx wrangler secret put MONITOR_TOKEN --config worker/wrangler.toml
   npx wrangler secret put RESEND_API_KEY --config worker/wrangler.toml
   npx wrangler deploy --config worker/wrangler.toml
   ```

6. Verify the whole chain.

   ```bash
   curl -sS https://cliproxy.sylvanyu.io/healthz
   curl -sS https://cliproxy.sylvanyu.io/readyz
   /Users/yuyufeng/.codex/skills/cliroxyapi-service/scripts/manage-cliroxyapi-service.sh smoke
   ```

7. Send a test alert email after DNS/provider setup.

   Use Resend with:

   ```text
   from: TabRecap Monitor <alerts@sylvanyu.io>
   to: me@sylvanyu.io
   ```

## Things Not To Forget

- The extension should use `https://cliproxy.sylvanyu.io/v1`.
- The Worker should use origin `https://cliproxy-origin.sylvanyu.io/v1`.
- The raw origin is not a public product API.
- `cliproxy.sylvanyu.io/healthz` is not enough; check `/readyz` or `smoke`.
- `/llm-readyz` costs a tiny model request and is protected by `MONITOR_TOKEN`.
- Resend is only for alerts; Migadu remains the mailbox provider for
  `me@sylvanyu.io`.
- Secret values live in Cloudflare Worker secrets and local config files, not in
  this repo.
